 Talia's Online Clothes Shop 

Hi! This is a small project I made using just HTML. It's a simple website for my online clothes shop where I share a bit about what I offer and how people can reach me.


  What the Website Is About

The site has a few basic sections:
- A welcome heading with my shop name
- A short about section explaining what my shop is
- A services section listing some of the clothes I sell (like t-shirts, jeans, and dresses)
- A contact section with my email so people can reach me
- A footer at the bottom with my name and year

That’s it for now, but I hope to keep adding more as I learn!

   Why I Made This

I'm learning how to build websites, and this is one of my practice projects assigned to me to try creating a basic web page from scratch and see how HTML works.

   How to View It

1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file using any browser (like Chrome or Edge).
3. You can scroll through the page and click on the links in the navigation to jump to different parts.

   What I Used

- HTML only (no CSS or JavaScript yet — I'm still learning those )

   Note

This is still a work in progress. I'll improve it as I learn more, such as adding styles and possibly making it responsive one day. Thanks for checking it out!
